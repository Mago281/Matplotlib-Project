**Matplotlib-Project**

Data visualization is paramount in effectively communicating insights derived from data analysis.

As a member of Pymaceuticals, Inc., a pharmaceutical company specializing in anti-cancer medications, I have embarked on an analysis focusing on potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a prevalent form of skin cancer.

**Project Overview**

For this project, I have been granted access to comprehensive data from Pymaceuticals' latest animal study. This study involved 249 mice diagnosed with SCC tumors, undergoing treatment with various drug regimens. Over a 45-day period, tumor development was meticulously observed and measured. The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, against alternative treatment regimens.

The executive team has entrusted me with the responsibility of generating all necessary tables and figures for the technical report of the clinical study. Additionally, they have requested a high-level summary of the study results.

To fulfill this mandate, I will conduct statistical tests to identify correlations within the datasets and create visualizations to elucidate my findings.

**Tools Utilized**

For this project, I leveraged Jupyter Notebook/Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scipy to present data effectively for Pymaceuticals.

**Project Steps**

*Step 1:	Data Preparation*

Upon receiving two Excel datasets, one containing metadata for each mouse and the other showcasing the study results, I meticulously checked for duplicates. Upon identification, data for Mouse g989 was extracted due to duplicate entries.

---

*Step 2:	Summary Statistics Generation*

I generated a comprehensive summary statistics table, including mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of tumor volume for each treatment regimen.

*Step 3:	Bar and Pie Charts Creation*

I created a bar chart to illustrate the total number of rows (Mouse ID/Timepoints) for each drug regimen and a pie chart showcasing the distribution of female versus male mice.

The bar graphs showed that the Drug Regimen Capomulin had the maximum number of mice and Propriva had the smallest number of mice.

The pie charts showed that 51% of mice tested were male and 49% were female.

*Step 4:	Quartiles Calculation and Outlier Identification*

Calculated the final tumor volume of each mouse across four treatment regimensâ€”Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Subsequently, I generated box plots to visualize the distribution of tumor volume, identifying outliers such as the Infubinol drug.

Calculated the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the treatment regimens:  Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin

Boxplots - Generated a box plot to show the distribution of the tumor volume for all the mice in each treatment group.

The box plot indicated an outlier: the Infubinol drug.  

An outlier is a data point that is significantly different from the rest of the data i.e. they could represent errors or unusual observations.  However, not all extreme values are necessarily errors; they sometimes represent valid data points that deviate from the central trend.

*Step 5:	Line and Scatter Plots Generation*

I produced a line plot depicting tumor volume vs. time point for a single mouse treated with Capomulin, providing insights into tumor progression. Additionally, I generated a scatter plot of mouse weight vs. the average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin regimen.

Line Graph - Generated a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for a single mouse treated with Capomulin.

This can be easily used to show results for any given mouse.

The line plot for Capomulin treatment of mouse I509 showed the tumor volume still increasing steadily up to Day 20, after which it dropped up to Day 25.  Then the tumor started to increase again for 5 days followed by a significant drop up to Day 35.  From Day 35, the tumor started increasing.

*Step 6:	Correlation and Regression Analysis*

Conducted correlation coefficient and linear regression analyses for mouse weight and average observed tumor volume within the Capomulin regimen. The analyses revealed a moderately strong positive linear relationship, indicating the potential predictive capabilities of the model.

Calculated the correlation coefficient and a linear regression model for mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin regimen.

The correlation between mouse weight and the average tumour volume is 0.84.
An R-value of 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, while an R-value of -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship.  An R-value of 0 suggests no linear relationship. 

The regression analysis showed us how much the average tumor volume changed when the weight of the mouse changed.  The R-value was 0.84, which means 84% of the model fit the data.  This is fairly good to use to predict the data from the model.  The heavier the mouse, the greater the tumor volume.  
In this instance, the correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume indicates a moderately strong positive linear relationship between the mouse weight and average tumor volume.

This means that the lines are reasonably good fits for the data, and can be used to make predictions about weight versus tumor volume.
Our analyses showed that the Capomulin and Ramicane drugs reduce the size of tumors best whilst the Propiva drug causes more harm than good.

Capomulin would be the preferred drug.

**Conclusion**
Our analysis underscores the efficacy of Capomulin and Ramicane in tumor reduction, while cautioning against the usage of Propiva due to adverse effects. Capomulin emerges as the preferred treatment option based on our findings.
